# chat_app_with_python_and_socket_io

This is a chatroom web-application. which is used to do group chat. There is no use of any databases because in This application there is no need to store messages.

I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the fronted and Flask for the backend.
I also used socketIO for realtime communication.

tools I have used :-

    flask              3.0.2  
    Flask-SocketIO     5.3.6
